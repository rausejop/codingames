Temperatures

Based on https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures

The Goal
    In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to
    find the closest to zero.

    Sample temperatures- Here, -1 is the closest to 0.

Rules
    Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among
    input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive
    integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if
    the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

Input
    Your program must read the data from the standard input and
    write the result on the standard output.

Input
    Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze
    Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

Output
    Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided.
    Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.

Constraints
    0 â‰¤ N < 10000
